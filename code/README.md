# Code Files
We first used webscraping code to download live bond data from BÃ¶rse Frankfurt to build our bond data base for the later structural model estimation. This code is contained in `Webscraping_Bond_Data`. 

We then use a matching method to match green bonds with similar conventional bonds to get a more focus dataset. This is contained in `test`.

Finally, `test2` contains the code for the  structural model estimation and calibration alongside with graph creation.
