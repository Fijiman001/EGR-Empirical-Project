got all green bonds and all conventional bonds
inner merge based on green bond emitters
added green identifier
removed bonds maturing in 2025
removed perpetual bonds or bonds without a maturity date in our data (ex. xs2675884576)
removed bonds emitted before 2020 (so only last 3 years) (going to 2022 would remove 112 out of 246 green bonds)
Remove Supranationals and nationals, only looking at corporates (EBRD, IBRD, EIB, KFW, ADB, EU)
This leaves us with 5203 bonds from 133 issuers and 246 green bonds


then get static data
merge with bond_dictionary, remove callable bonds, remove supras.
then have final bond_dictionary with static data, to merge with price data
we have 809 bonds in our bond_dictionary, of which 200 are green

of those, we have 196 bonds for which we have price data giving us a final preliminary data set of 8000 rows
